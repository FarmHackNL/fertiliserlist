# List of sold/available fertilizers

A lot of different fertilizers are sold. For regulations, growth-optimization and 
comparisson calculations a user of fertilizer needs to keep track of the used products with their
compound specifications. This data-package aims to provide a list of available fertilizers in a
country with their relevant attributes.

This list provides a common/trade name, a code, unit of application, nutrients-contents, and more.

We aim to make this a reasonably complete list.
